# SK6812viaSPI
Drive SK6812 Neopixel Clones Using the SPI Data PIN

Working:
  ESK8166 - YES Perfectly
  
  Raspberry Pi A+ - YES but flickers sometimes, hs something to do with the SPI packet not going oout in time
  
  NanoPi Neo Air - Yes, need to use Pixel 0 as a NULL Driver pixel to boost 3.3v to 5 for the rest of the strip
